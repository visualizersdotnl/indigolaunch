priority:
- fix VS solution
- port to Direct3D 11 & ditch D3DX (big task!)
- gamma correct rendering (involves changing buffer & texture formats, mostly)
- fix sprites (see TPB-xxx)
- create centralized resource loader
- grab default browser instead of Firefox
- move GetExitCodeProcess() wait loop to a non-blocking location
- review XInput code (continuous polling is slow & controller not properly re-detected after removal)
- crash guard (see TPB-xxx)
- block screen saver and/or power management
- verify startup path
- see about reenabling C++ exceptions?
- perhaps log style output to the console instead of message box error reporting?
  in any case, do something about it!
- ToString() has got to go, toute de suite!

customer tasks #1 (free):
- fix launch glitch (run in "fake" full screen)
- facilitate faster (semi-exponential?) scrolling through titles

customer tasks #2 (not approved yet):
- built-in video & SWF support (SWF support price still has to be negotiated)

features:
- research full browser integration
- support multiple collections (use subdirectories?)
- write a guide for indie developers for compatibility
- decouple actual game and metadata location
- tactile feedback (X360)
- UI: support variable box art dimensions & improve animation
- tweakable audio?
- add setup dialog like in TPB-xxx?
- missing (asset): platform icons (Ouya, Vita, 3DS, web, ...)
- discuss: developer logo currently unused, what to do?

refactoring:
- retrofit C++11
- use a NoCopy class where appropriate (e.g. Title) (steal edited Boost::noncopyable from TPB-xxx)
- redesign metadata XML
- use more string streams
- clean up top-level UI manager (Flow)
- rename enumerated types (use prefix: i.e. kInputBack instead of kBack)
- make renderer core functions private (befriend WinMain())
- search for 'hack', 'FIXME' et cetera and review each case

future plans:
- editor (Fuse?) & deploy mechanism
  + is there no existing tool that could author this content for us?
- make PDF manual?
